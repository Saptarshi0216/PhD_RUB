# Method 1:
a)Open the file named workbook.ipynb in the repository. 
b)Click on the 'open with colab' option to be re-directed to a google colab file with the python script. 
c)Execute the file.

# Method 2:
#we might want to keep a copy of the code in the local device, and use it with google colab or any other scripting notebook such as Jupyter.
a)Open the terminal
b)Move to a suitable directory where you would like to download the files
b)execute, $git clone https://github.com/Saptarshi0216/PhD_RUB.git
The README file as well as the python script workbook.ipynb is now downloaded in the directory.
C)Now you can open any notebook of your choice and import the python script, followed by executing the same.

# Make-up for the script
The body of the code is organised as follows,
import of libraries

specifying initial conditions i.e. the lifetimes of each charm hadron needed to be represented. Here we have also calculated the radius for each pie, since the areas of the pie must be proportional to their lifetimes

Body: creation of plots and adding specifications if needed. Here we also comment out the information about the quark constituent for each type of hadron.

The code is followed by the output.
